# Climate Change Modeling using Machine Learning 

## 📌 Project Overview
Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. This project analyzes **climate change trends** using **Machine Learning and NLP techniques**. By examining **climate-related social media discussions, temperature changes, and CO₂ levels**, we aim to identify trends, sentiments, and key concerns related to climate change.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- **Dataset Source:** Climate Change Research & Social Media Data
- **Features:**
  - Temperature changes
  - CO₂ levels and ocean acidity
  - Social media discussions on climate change
  - Public sentiment and engagement
- **Target Variable:** Climate Change Impact Scores

## 🔬 Methodology
### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned dataset using **Pandas and NumPy**.
- Applied **text processing techniques** (Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization).

### **2️⃣ NLP Analysis**
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determined whether social media discussions were **positive, neutral, or negative**.
- **Topic Modeling:** Used **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to extract key topics related to climate change.
- **Trend Analysis:** Identified growing concerns about **extreme weather, government policies, and carbon emissions**.
- **Engagement Analysis:** Analyzed how people engage with climate-related discussions on social media.

### **3️⃣ Model Implementation**
- **Machine Learning Model Used:** Random Forest for climate trend forecasting.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and accuracy scores.

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Increasing **negative sentiment** towards climate policies in recent years.
- **Extreme weather events** cause spikes in climate discussions.
- **Predictive models suggest** rising public concerns over global warming.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Implement **real-time climate monitoring dashboards**.
- Extend analysis using **satellite image processing**.
- Integrate **deep learning models** to improve accuracy in climate trend forecasting.
